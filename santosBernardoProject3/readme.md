### Project 3

This project aimed at creating a small-scale social media where users can create accounts and follow each other, while also being able to publish content (with a focus on YouTube embbeded videos) and comment on each other's posts.

The website has 4 main pages:

1. Home Page (Feed) -> Contains the user's feed, with all of the user's posts and the user's friends' posts. It also contains a link to the user's friends page at the top.
2. Profile Page -> Contains the user profile, allowing the user to edit the profile picture, header picture, and bio. 
3. Friends Page -> Contains cards of all the friends of the user, allowing the user to unfollow each one of them and visit their pages. It allows the user to send an e-mail to someone else inviting them to join the website and also allows the user to go to the discover page.
4. Discover Page -> Contains cards of all the website's users, allowing the user to discover new friends (allows for search as well).

Here is a demo of the website:
