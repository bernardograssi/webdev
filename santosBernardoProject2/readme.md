### Project 2

This project aimed at creating an image gallery in the home page, where the user could interact with by sorting and hovering over the images to discover information about them.

The website has 3 pages:

1. Home Page -> Contains the image gallery, alongside a navigation bar and a footer.
2. About Page -> Contains cards that explain the reason why the images from the home page were selected and has a summary of the topics chosen.
3. Contact Page -> Contains a form to be filled by the user in order to send an e-mail to the website manager, simulating a "Contact Us" page.

Here is a demo of the website:
