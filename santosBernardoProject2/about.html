                            Astronomy has always been a core field of interest in my academic endeavours.
                            When I was 10 years old, I tried to make a compilation of all the interesting astronomical
                            facts and theories and
                            put them together in a single book. During my teenage years, that interest grew
                            exponentially, as I began getting in touch
                            with more advanced scientific and philosphical materials, which naturally led me to question
                            what we are doing in this universe,
                            why and how are we here? And of course, to understand that, I had to understand the universe
                            itself first, and astronomy, alongside
                            physics, were the areas I had no other choice but to explore.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            This attempt to connect the dots of the puzzle that the meaning of life presents to us would
                            be meaningless without astronomy.
                            To the uncautious observer, astronomy should not be important when a human being is trying
                            to understand its purpose and
                            meaning in life, but for the most careful one, it is clear that astronomy is way more than
                            just observing stars and comets, it
                            is actually a vital key to understand why we are here and how it all came to be.

                            Greek mythology has been a topic I have been interested for a while now. As a kid I used to think that the Greek gods existed for real, 
                            but as I grew older and understood that myths are instrisically not true, I understood that although they did not exist in real life, 
                            the Greek gods had a strong influence in the conception of Western civilization as we know today.
                            <br><br>
                            Besides subtle influences on language, such as by giving names to certain words/expressions like "Herculean task", "aphrodisiac", "morphine", 
                            and "trojans" (computer viruses), Greek mythology had a substantial impact in the arts and culture. Sandro Boticelli's <i>The Birth 
                            of Venus</i> and Dante Alighieri's frequent references to Greek mythology are two examples of where the art/culture sepctrum is evaded 
                            by the influence of Greek mythology. 
                            <br><br>
                            And of course, even astronomy had suffered from the influence of the Greek, as many constellations and planets carry the names of Greek mythological 
                            characters, such as Venus, Andromeda, and Gemini. I always thought this topic was fascinating and represents an important piece of mankind's 
                            endeavour to explain the world as it is and how we as species were conceived.

                            I do not know how a person in the 21st century would be able to go after the meaning of life
                            and understand his purpose in the
                            universe without first going through the teachings of the Greek philosophers. Through the
                            early teachings of Socrates, Plato,
                            and Aristotle, mankind was able to take important steps in the direction of understanding
                            the universe as it is, and how
                            humans are important in it.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Socrates, known as the founder of philosphy, had a meaningful impact in the way that people
                            used to think. Through his
                            dialetics and his personal way of finding out the truth, he presented to mankind the act of
                            philosophizing. Socrates,
                            who was condemned to death in Athens for corrupting the youth of the time, understood that
                            for knowledge to be acquired, it must
                            first be put through judgement and "be cast on fire", and if it survives, it is meaningful.
                            His impact on my personal journey had
                            much to do with the fact that I became a person who would understand how unlikely it is that
                            everything I thought I knew was actually
                            true. Socrates humbled me and thought me to question everything, no matter what.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Plato conveyed and expanded the work of his teacher Socrates, and founded The Academy, which
                            is most likely one of the world's first university
                            and the place where he trained his pupil, Aristotle. Besides having that influence on
                            building the foundations of the Western's way of
                            teaching, he had a massive influence on my thought through his belief on the importance of
                            mathematics in education. It has proven to be
                            essential for understanding the entire universe and has helped me out quite a lot thus far.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            From Aristotle, we can learn the basis of physicial sciences as we know today. He was
                            responsible for the first
                            questions about nature, how it works, why it works the way it does, and what is our place in
                            it? He built the foundation
                            of modern science alongside other many thinkers, who were also thirsty for knowledge. Most
                            of the scientifical work in the
                            Middle Ages were based on Aristotelian thought and ideas.

                            The stoics were for sure the ones who had the deepest impact on myself. Basically, stoicism
                            is a school of Philosophy founded by Zeno of
                            Citium in Athens in the early 3rd century BC. Besides the influence of its founder, the
                            stoic school had on Seneca, Epictetus, and
                            Roman Emperor Marcus Aurelius its prominent spokepersons.
                            <br><br>
                            The Stoic school believes in 4 essential values in human life: Courage, Temperance, Justice,
                            and Wisdom. They are konwn for teaching that
                            "virtue" is the only good for human beings, and external things such as wealth, fame, and
                            pleasure are not good or bad in themselves, but
                            have value as "material ofr virtue to act upon". Being virtuous, for the Stoics, had much to
                            do with distinguishing what is in your control
                            and what is not in your control in life. They also believed that the best indication of an
                            individual's philosophy was not what a
                            person said but how a person behaved, and in order to live a good life, one had to
                            understand the rules of the natural order since they
                            thought everything was rooted in nature.
                            <br><br>
                            Stoicism played a critical role in making me understanding the world I am in. It was through
                            Stoicism that I became a very down-to-earth person,
                            aware of the externality of all the events of the world, meaning that the events that occur
                            are external to me, other people's feelings and opinions
                            are also external. It thought me that I had to care about what I can control, and nothing
                            else. It made me way more resilient and had me focus on
                            myself, my own development, and my own core feelings.

                            It is fairly obvious why human history is important to understand the universe and help
                            understand the meaning of life. I only got really
                            into history when I was around 19-20 years old, as it was the time I realized that for me to
                            understand the present, I need to get in touch
                            with the past and be conscious of what has happened to mankind so far. Well, history is
                            basically a story of the human race, and it tells us
                            a lot of how humans have changed and how the conceptions of the universe have shifted
                            drastically.
                            <br><br>
                            My initial interest in history came from my studies of Art History, but it quickly spread
                            out to other topics such as prehistory,
                            Muslim history, Greek history, and, of course, Brazilian history. I could not leave the
                            history of my country behind, because I deeply believe
                            that a man who does not know history is faded to repeat the same mistakes of the past, and I
                            do not want to have Brazil repeat the same mistakes
                            of the past. Ever.
                            <br><br>
                            From my studies of history, I was able to understand how the <i>homo sapiens</i> evolved, how it
                            dominated the neanderthals, and how the human life
                            has changed so much in some aspects (such as by technological development) and yet so little
                            in others (we still struggle to understand our
                            meaning in the universe). Besides that, I could get a grasp on how civilizations emerged and
                            developed, how countries were born and how they
                            dominated others through the power of coersion. I understood how governments arose and how
                            they have nothing to do with human development.
                            There is a reason why things are the way they are today, and history teaches us that. But we
                            must not forget that if we want to change
                            the world, we must look back in the past for inspiration.

                            Philosophy as a whole played a massive role in my path to self-discovery and in my attempt
                            to understand the meaning of life. As aforemnetioned,
                            the Greek philosophers and the stoics were important for me, but I cannot leave behind the
                            other two schools of philosophy that shaped my
                            thought so much.
                            <br><br>
                            Firstly, Rationalism. Through the lens of René Descartes and mainly Baruch Spinoza, I managed to see the world
                            through a completely different perspective than I used to. When I firstly got in touch with Spinoza's concept of God,
                            my mind was completely blown away because I realized that what he was saying was exactly what I used to believe, but 
                            could not put into words. <i>Deus sive natura</i>, Spinoza's slogan in Latin for "God or Nature", represents the view 
                            that God and Nature are interchangeable, so that there is no distinction between the creator and the creation. Besides
                            his influence on my conception of God/Nature, Spinoza, in alignment with the stoics, thought me that a virtuous life
                            is one made out of simplicity, and that a virtuous man is a man who lives according to reason. "The highest activity 
                            a human being can attain is learning for understanding, because to understand is to be free."
                            <br><br>
                            Now, the existentialists. Albert Camus is my favorite existentialist philosopher, although he did not like to be labeled
                            as "existentialist". It was through his work that I could understand that there is no inherent/objective meaning in life,
                            but subjective meaning. Instead of believing in an objective meaning as Søren Kierkegaard did, Camus believed that each of us
                            have to discover what we are here for. For some, it may be simple and take a few years to find out, whereas for others, 
                            it may take a lifetime to figure it out. Through the Myth of Sisyphus, Albert Camus convinced me of the absurdity of life, but also
                            of the fact that we ought to bravely face it every day of our lives.
                            <br><br>
                            Søren Kierkegaard has an important play in my life because he, just like Baruch Spinoza, was brave enough to go against the common
                            sense of his days, and had no fear of speaking his truth, no matter how disliked it was. Although I am not a huge fan of his personal
                            philosophy, I do respect his bravery for speaking his mind and for enduring the many problems life brought to him.

                            Art played an important role in my discovery of the classics. It was through art that I had my curiosity estimulated for history
                            and philosophy. I still remember to this day when I first saw Rafael's masterpiece <i>School of Athens</i> and Michelangelo's <i>David</i>.
                            I remember how amazed I was by the fact that they made works of art so close to perfection such a long time ago. What had me intrigued was the
                            references they had in their works and the incentives behind each work. I became fascinated with the fact that these wonderful artists knew so 
                            much about the classic Greco-Roman culture, which led me to study a little bit of that as well.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            The period of the Renaissance was for sure the one that grabbed most of my interest in this field, as I believe the most wonderful works of art
                            were produced in this period. It was in the Renaissance that several artistic techniques were developed, such as the chiaroscuro, perspective, 
                            foreshortening, and proportion. Amazed by the beauty of the masterpieces produced by Michelangelo, Rafael, Leonardo da Vinci, Rembrandt, and 
                            Jacques-Louis David, I wanted to learn more about the things they were painting or sculpting. Looking at their works, I wanted to understand why
                            Michelangelo would depict the Biblical figure <i>David</i> and <i>The Creation of Adam</i>the way he did, or why Rafael would depict <i>The School 
                            of Athens</i> the way he did.

                            Although this is probably the only topic in this page that does not belong to the academic or scientific spectrum, I put playing soccer as 
                            one of the most important things that happend to me. To quote Albert Camus, who happened to be a goalkeeper just as I am, "everything I've 
                            learned on ethics comes from [playing] soccer". Playing this sport really changed my life and I will explain why.
                            <br><br>
                            Since a kid, I used to love the game, always played on the streets of Brazil, and always nurtured an unexplainable love for my hometown club,
                            Atlético Mineiro, depicted in the image. The love I have always felt for this club surpasses the limits of reason. Through the good and bad times,
                            I have always been there supporting the "Galo" (Rooster) as it is known back home. But I never played the game seriously until I was around 15 
                            years of age, which was when I began practicing for real and bagan playing games. 
                            <br><br>
                            During 2015 and 2016 I played for a club in Minas Gerais called Paraense F.C., where I created strong bonds with players I had never seen 
                            before, and if it was not for soccer, I would most likely never meet. That team was a real family and we went through a lot together, always 
                            working hard and pushing ourselves to the limit. I still remember when I had my first save in a penalty shootout that led the team to the 
                            quarter-finals of the state championship. The feeling was unknown to me. The feeling of beating adversity. The feeling of making your coaches 
                            and teammates proud. The feeling of making yourself proud. That day made me realize soccer was way more than just a game, it was part of my 
                            DNA. 
                            <br><br>
                            From playing in U-15 and U-17 championships in 2015-2016 to playing amateur championships in 2017-2018, I took a major step in my career and 
                            began playing with "the big boys". Such a period was of tremendous learning for me, on and off the field. From being the 3rd keeper who no one 
                            talked cared about to being the unlikely hero of the City Championship Finals in 2017, I learned that limits, like fears, are just an illusion. 
                            Soccer taught me I should never get comfortable with myself and my skills, and that I should always strive for more, because there is always 
                            something I can improve. It thought me what love is, because I can still remember the passion and love in the eyes of my teammates when we 
                            were playing throughout Minas Gerais as the underdogs who no one thought much of. Although it gave me great momments I will never forget, 
                            it taught me how to recover from the low moments of life, because it has shown me that no matter how down you are, you can always rise again. 
                            <br><br> 
                            And of course, soccer gave me the opportunity to come to the United States pursue my undergraduate degree, something that was unimaginable for 
                            me a few years ago. To soccer I owe much of who I am, and much of who I will become.
