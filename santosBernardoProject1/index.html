                <p>The World Cup of 2002 was hosted by South Korea and Japan, the first time that two countries shared the tourney.</p>
                <p>The Brazilian National Team came to the tourney under the climate of suspicious over its potential, as the campaign over the World Cup qualifiers was weak, and Ronaldo and Rivaldo, two of the
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil_national_football_team">Seleção's</a> best players, had just returned from injury.
                </p>
                <p>The Seleção was commanded by Luiz Felipe Scolari, known as Felipão. Brazil had some legends in the squad: goalkeepers Marcos, Dida, and Rogério; center-backs Lúcio, Juan, Roque Jr., Anderson, and Edmilson; outside-backs Cafu, Belletti,
                    and Júnior; midfielders Gilberto, Ricardinho, Kaká, Kléberson, Denilson, Vampeta, Juninho, and Ronaldinho; strikers Ronaldo, Rivaldo, Luizão, and Edilson. </p>
                <p>The group stage was not too demanding, as Brazil beat Turkey 2-1, Costa Rica 5-2, and China 4-0. However, in the Round of 16, Brazil suffered to beat Belgium 2-0, in a controversial match. Then it rolled over England with a 2-1 win and
                    a brilliant display from the South Americans, moving then to beat Turkey 1-0 in the semi-finals, and Germany 2-0 in the final.</p>
                <p>The glory achieved by this select group of soccer players lives in the soul of every single Brazilian born before the 30th of June of 2002. This was the 5th, and currently last time Brazil won the World Cup.</p>

                <p>Commanded by Carlos Alberto Parreira, the Brazilians were not title contenders for the World Cup disputed in American soil, although the squad contained a few world class players, such as the goalkeeper Taffarel, center-back Ricardo Rocha, outside-backs
                    Jorginho and Branco, midfielders Dunga and Raí, and the ferocious strikers Bebeto and Romário.</p>
                <p>In the group stage, the Seleção beat Russia 2-0 and Cameroon 3-0, but then tied 1-1 with Sweden. In the Round of 16, the Brazilians challenged the Americans 1-0, and in the quarter-finals, Holland was upset by Brazil's powerhouse with
                    a 3-2 final score. In the semi-finals, Brazil led a tough win of 1-0 against Sweden, with a brilliant effort from the "baixinho" (shorty) Romário to score from a header. They moved to face Italy in the final, which ended up 0-0 and had Brazil win in the penalty
                    shootouts for 3-2 after Italian midfielder maestro Roberto Baggio sent his penalty kick astray.</p>
                <p>This was the 4th time Brazil won the World Cup, and it is known in Brazil as the "Romário World Cup", due to the fantastic perfomance from the Brazilian striker throughout the whole tournament.</p>

                <p>Known and the "Greatest Team", the Brazilian National Team of 1970 is probably the best side to ever play a World Cup. The team was simply unbeatable. It cruised through the opponents and brough back home the 3rd world title. It was the first
                    time that a National Team had won the World Cup 3 times.</p>
                <p>Commanded by the legendary manager Zagallo, the Seleção scored 19 goals in 6 games, many of them as consequences of exuberant plays from Jairzinho, Gerson, Tostão, Pelé, and Rivellino.</p>
                <p>In the first game of the group stage, Brazil defeated Czechoslovakia 4-1. The second game was essential for the Seleção, because it was against England, the reigning champions. It was in this game that
                    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngE9RCAdWaE">Gordon Banks pulled out one of the greatest saves ever made by a goalkeeper,</a> after a header from Pelé. The game finished 1-0 for the Brazilians,
                     with a goal from the talented Botafogo playmaker Jairzinho. The third game was played against Romenia and had the Brazilians celebrating a 3-2 win in the end. The quarter-final was played against Peru, and the Seleção won 4-2. In the semi-finals
                     against Uruguay, the Brazilians won 3-1, leading their way to the final against Italy. Oh and what a final game it was. Brazil defeated Italy 4-1, with goals from Pelé, Gerson, Jairzinho, and Carlos Alberto Torres. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RIuzgf9X_8">The goal from Torres</a> is 
                     considered a masterpiece and shows exactly the spirit of that super-team: hard-worker, technically flawless, and clever on the ball. </p>
                <p>The Greatest Team conquered the world in 1970, leaving a mark in sports history forever.</p>

                <p>In 1962, Chile was the host of the World Cup. It was only 2 years after the worst earthquake in mankind history hit them, leaving more than a thousand dead, and 2 million homeless. Chile, however, managed to recover from this disaster and host the World Cup.</p>
                <p>Brazil's 1958 manager was not in charge anymore, being replaced by Aymoré Moreira. Among the stars of that team were Pelé, Vavá, Zagallo, Nilton Santos, Djalma Santos, Didi, Amarildo, and Garrincha, the one who stole the show in that tourney. </p>
                <p>In the group stage, Brazil defeated Mexico 2-0, and Spain 2-1, but tied 0-0 with Czechoslovakia. Pelé, the world's best player by then, got injured against Czechoslovakia, and although it was a major hit to the team, it meant it was time for Garrincha
                     to step up and assume the role of the Seleção's best player. In the quarter-finals, Brazil beat England 3-1, with 2 goals from Garrincha and 1 from Vavá. The semi-finals saw Brazil beat Chile 4-2, with 2 goals from Vavá and 2 from Garrincha. In the
                      final, Brazil played Czechoslovakia once again, but this time winning 3-1.</p>
                      <p>It was the first time a player won the Golden Ball (Player of the Tournament), Golden Boot (Leading Goalscorer), and the World Cup in the same tournament. The player who did it was Garrincha. The legendary player from Botafogo, Rio de Janeiro, 
                          left his mark in history by bringing the 2nd World Cup title back to Brazil, where it belongs.</p>

                <p>The 1958 World Cup hosted by Sweden had its importance in history: it was the first World Cup that Pelé played, when he was only 17 years old. It was also the edition where French striker Just Fontaine scored 13 goals, the record for a single edition (still held to this day).</p>
                <p>Commanded by Vicente Feola, Brazil was not considered a serious title contender, but had the admiration of the fans because of the technical quality of its players. Brazil defeated Austria 3-0 and the Soviet Union by 2-0 in the group stage, but tied 0-0 with England. It moved on to beat Wales in 
                    the quarter-finals, with Pelé scoring his first goal in a World Cup. Against the French powerhouse in the semi-finals, Brazil had a tough game but ended up winning 5-2, with 3 goals from Pelé. The final was played against the hosting team, Sweden, and the home crowd saw its team 
                    get torn apart by the Brazilans, with Pelé scoring twice, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYNsrKtV6Mc&t=68s"> one of them being one of the greatest goals of all time in World Cup history.</a></p>
                <p>1958 was Brazil's first World Cup title, and the year the world saw Pelé and Garrincha rise to stardom. This was the beginning of the Seleção's trail to become known worldwide as the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWnS2dIDgQA">"País do Futebol" </a>(Soccer Country, in English).</p>
