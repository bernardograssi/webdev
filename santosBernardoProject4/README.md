### Project 4

This project aimed at creating a small-scale music webplayer that allows the user to add .mp3 files, delete them, and play them. The user is also allowed to see the activity of the people followed, if they are online/offline and which songs are being currently played.

The website has 1 main page:

1. Home Page -> User can add a song via the button at the navigation bar, as well as add a profile picture. The user can delete a song that has been added, play the song, change the volume, and see the user's friends' activities.

Here is a demo of the website:
